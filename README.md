# Learning React

This repository is for me to learn React.

A GitHub Action is used to automatically build and deploy the solution to Azure Static Pages.  The site is here: [https://mango-pond-0139fe603.1.azurestaticapps.net/](https://mango-pond-0139fe603.1.azurestaticapps.net/)

I'm going to add pages that demonstrate the following:

- [x] Routing
- [x] Components
- [ ] Props
- [ ] Handling Events
- [ ] State
- [x] Calling external APIs
- [ ] Tailwind CSS (yes, I know this isn't React)

### Setting up a new React project.

- `npm create vite@latest`
  Select React and then TypeScript
- `npm i`
- `npm run dev`
