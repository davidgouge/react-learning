# Learning React

This repository is for me to learn React.

I'm going to add pages that demonstrate the following:

- [ ] Routing
- [ ] Components
- [ ] Props
- [ ] Handling Events
- [ ] State
- [ ] Calling external APIs
- [ ] Tailwind CSS (yes, I know this isn't React)

### Setting up a new React project.

- `npm create vite@latest`
  Select React and then TypeScript
- `npm i`
- `npm run dev`
